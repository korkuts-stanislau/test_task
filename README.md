<h3>Hello, it's my repository for creating model that solves a problem of binary classification for IMDB Movies Dataset.</h3>
There are 3 python notebooks in imdb folder.<br>
Notebook EDA.ipynb is a notebook for IMDB Movies analysis.<br>
Notebook Experiments.ipynb is a notebook for experiments with different feature extractors and classifiers.<br>
In this notebook, I decide which model to use to solve a binary classification problem.<br>
Notebook ModelMaking.ipynb is a notebook for validating and tuning selected model.<br>
<br>
<h4>These notebooks were created on my week laptop. If you want to look at another solution look for it in folder google_colab.</h4>
IMDB_EDA.ipynb is a notebook for analysis of dataset<br>
IMDB_Experiments.ipynb is a notebook for experiments with BOW-like models<br>
IMDB_SequencesModelExperiments.ipynb is a notebook for experiments with Sequence-like models
