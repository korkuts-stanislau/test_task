Hello, it's my repository for creating model that solves a problem of binary classification for IMDB Movies Dataset.
There are 3 python notebooks.
Notebook EDA.ipynb is a notebook for IMDB Movies analysis.
Notebook Experiments.ipynb is a notebook for experiments with different feature extractors and classifiers. 
In this notebook, I decide which model to use to solve a binary classification problem.
Notebook ModelMaking.ipynb is a notebook for validating and tuning selected model.
