<h3>Hello, it's my repository for creating model that solves a problem of binary classification for IMDB Movies Dataset.</h3>
There are 3 python notebooks.<br>
Notebook EDA.ipynb is a notebook for IMDB Movies analysis.<br>
Notebook Experiments.ipynb is a notebook for experiments with different feature extractors and classifiers.<br>
In this notebook, I decide which model to use to solve a binary classification problem.<br>
Notebook ModelMaking.ipynb is a notebook for validating and tuning selected model.
